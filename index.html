         All of my friends and I went over to Maya's house and
          Maya decorated the house so aesthetically and cute an dwe all brought
          food like a potluck. The night was filled with so much laughter and
          fun.

          It was so restorative and I got to see all of my
          favorite people, sleep and eat really good.It was laso such a nice
          pace it didin't feel super rushed or slow to me. I of course wish it
          was longer butit wass so enjoyablke and fun I don't care.

          My whole frined group matched pj's and it was
          just so cute. We were on the ferry and made random people take
          pictures of us in our matching, fuzzy, reindeer pajama pants and I
          couldn't stop laughing and smiling. It was justv a really good time.
