          All of my friends and I went over to Maya's house and Maya decorated
          the house so aesthetically and cute and we all brought food like a
          potluck. The night was filled with so much laughter and fun.

          It was so restorative and I got to see all of my favorite people,
          sleep and eat really good. It was laso such a nice pace it didn't feel
          super rushed or slow to me. I of course wish it was longer but it was
          so enjoyable and fun I don't care. A place that was so fun and
          relaxing to go to was the Chinese Scholar Gardens in Snug Harbor.

          My whole friend group matched pj's and it was just so cute. We were on
          the ferry and made random people take pictures of us in our matching,
          fuzzy, reindeer pajama pants and I couldn't stop laughing and smiling.
          It was justv a really good time.
